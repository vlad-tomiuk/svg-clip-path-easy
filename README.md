# Clip-Path Creator
🚀 **Convenient Tool for Creating and Editing Clip-Paths from SVGs**

This tool allows you to easily and quickly convert any SVG into a clip-path that can be effortlessly edited and scaled using CSS. The core functionality is based on [svg-path-to-polygons](https://github.com/gavin-kistner/svg-path-to-polygons) by Gavin Kistner (MIT License). I've extended the tool by adding several features and writing a guide on how to improve the quality of the resulting shape.

## Key Features:
🔄 **Convert SVG paths to polygons** for cleaner and more manageable clip-paths.  
📏 **Easily resize and edit shapes** through CSS for responsive design.  
✨ **Optimized shapes** with normalization for consistent rendering across different devices.  
📖 **Step-by-step instructions** included on how to enhance shape quality.

## Example:
Here's an example of the tool in action:
